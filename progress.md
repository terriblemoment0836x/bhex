### Done:
    - Implement dumping as hex/bin/oct.
    - Implement showing ascii output of each line.
    - Factorise the damn code, its a mess.
    - Add color support.

    - Add support for changing the program behavior using arguments. **
    - Document the code
    - optimize the buffer size
    - Add a variety of colors
    - Error handling and make a consistant use of bool
    - make the address relative to the file size
    - Check for color support in the running terminal
    - Set up the repo.
    - Handling SIGTERM with reset of colors
    - Add a basic bruteforce implementation of searching for strings.

### Todo:
    - Code testing
    - Linux support

    An other time:
    --- version (alpha) ---
    - Optimisation
    - check for overflows
    --- version 0.1 (beta) ---
